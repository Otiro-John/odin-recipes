<h2>Steps</h2>
<p></p>
<ol>
<h4>Step:</h4>
<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-quart casserole dish.</li>
<h4>Step:</h4>
<li>Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; season with salt and pepper. Layer onion slices over top, then top with with remaining potatoes. 
Season again with salt and pepper</li>
<h4>Step:</h4>
<li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor has cooked off, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking well after each addition to incorporate; 
the gradual addition and whisking of milk will help avoid lumps in your sauce.</li>
<h4>Step:</h4>
<li>Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted, 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, 
and cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
<h4>Step:</h4>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is bubbly, about 1 Â½ hours.</li>
